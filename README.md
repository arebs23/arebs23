### Hi there 👋
# Victor Oloyede Aregbede


I am a final year PhD student at Örebro University  
My research focuses on embodied affordance representations that bridge perception and robotic action.

I build multimodal systems that convert visual and language inputs into structured, actionable outputs for autonomous manipulation.
